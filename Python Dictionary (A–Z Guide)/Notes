1. What is a Dictionary?
  A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
  Keys are unique & immutable (string, int, tuple).
  Values can be any type (string, list, dict, etc.).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
student = {
    "name": "Ajay",
    "age": 25,
    "skills": ["Python", "Testing", "Debugging"]
}
name, age, skills = keys
Ajay, 25, ["Python", "Testing", "Debugging"] = values
